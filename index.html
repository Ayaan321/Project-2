            <p>The reason I like doing Raspberry Pi projects is because there are lots of different projects you can do with it like a camera, a gamin console etc. Another reason is because I love doing coding and connecting/building things. The final reason is because lots of people have videos to teach me to learn about it and it has a LOT of projects for you to do.</p>
